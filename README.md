# TeamFARepo
 Faris and Ahmad's team repository for CS-1501 Week 3

 @FARIS
Looks like we each need to branch this repo and do some work on it.
That work involves a .md file and a .<any language> file
We also need to solve 1 leetcode problem in any language.
I prefer Java, but Python seems to be recommended.
Remember, don't edit the main branch!

PS - We cannot double dip this leetcode problem and use it for a professional development activity. So perhaps while we're at it, let's solve a few and knock out multiple birds with oen stone.
